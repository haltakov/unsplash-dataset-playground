# Unsplash Dataset Playground

The goal of this project is to explore and play around with the [Unsplash dataset](https://unsplash.com/data). I'll be sharing my experience with it [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/haltakov).

## Getting Started

In order to get started, take a look at [this Jupyter notebook](scripts/explore_download_view_ratio.ipynb) exploring the download/views ratio as a proxy for the photo quality.

If you want to run the notebook yourself, download the dataset and put the data in the `unsplash-dataset` folder. See [here](unsplash-dataset/README.md) for instruction.

## What's next?

I plan to itry different machine learning algos to find out features that distinguish good photos from great ones.
